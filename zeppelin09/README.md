# A modified official Apache Zeppelin docker container

Modifications : 
- current official docker container is still on the 0.9 preview version (0.9.0 has been released)
- image based on ubuntu 20.04
- python 3.7 by default instead of python 2 or python 3.8 (zeppelin is buggy with 3.8)
- dependencies are installed on python 3.7
